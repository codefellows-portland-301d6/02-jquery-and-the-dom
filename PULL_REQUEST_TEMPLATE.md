#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Nathan and John paired together. It took about 90 minutes**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started with discussing the work to do, then beginning with the JS.
  2. Next, we continued with more JS changes.
  3. Then added script tags to the html, so we could easily check our work.
  4. Finally, completed the JS and will process the git/GitHub.
